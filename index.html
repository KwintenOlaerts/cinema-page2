            <h2>What is 248?</h2>
            <p>248 is nothing more than a state of mind, shared by a group of people.
            The original founder was Kwinten Olaerts, also known as Lerr.<br>
            After letting the vision grow and manifest he shared his idea with his good friend and college Lander Willems.<br>
            Completely embracing this mind-state, together they formed a music group with an emphasis on their beliefs.<br>
            Hard work, always having fun, not letting doubt create mental blocks and knowing that succes is something that adds up, just like compound intrest.<br>
            <br>It is a metafor, which is substracted from the well known '1,2,3'.<br>
            The truth is, what holds value doesn't come easy and what is easy rarely holds value.<br>
            We love the think we can fix things in a hurry, but we should embrace the the progress.<br>
            And realize that the further we go in something, the harder it is to reach the next step.<br>
            But luckely, as it gets harder every step, the rewards get bigger too.<br>
            First you go from 2 to 4, then you have to fill in a bigger gap, but get a bigger reward.<br>
            It is for everybody who works hard, too make em keep the faith and embrace this valuable mindset.<br>
